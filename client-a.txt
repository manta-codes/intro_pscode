Objective: Guess the Number Game
Specifications: Player has 3 tries to guess a number between 1 and 10 chosen randomly by the computer

1. Generate random number between 1 and 10. 
2. Store randomly generated number in variable (randnumber).
3. Prompt User for guess (Input), restricting response to a number between 1 and 10.
4. Store user response in variable (userreponse).
5. Set variable for guess count (guesscounter) to 1. 
6. Apply conditional logic comparing userresponse to randnumber.
    If userreponse != randnumber AND guesscounter < 3:
        Print "Incorrect! Try again! {3 - guesscounter} guesses remaining!"
        Repeat step 4
        Increase guesscounter by 1
    If userreponse != randnumber AND guesscounter = 3:
        Print "Incorrect! Try again! Final guess!"
        Repeat step 4
        Increase guesscounter by 1
    If userreponse == randnumber:
        Print "Congratulations! You've guessed correctly"
        End program.
    If guesscounter > 3 AND userreponse != randnumber:
        Print "Incorrect! Better luck next time!"
        End program.
