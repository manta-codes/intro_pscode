# ------------------------------------------------- #

Objective: Develop a mapping application to find a specific location in a large warehouse store for a customer.
Restrictions: Customer can move north, south, east, or west

1. Establish coordinates for accessible area of warehouse store. Determine width of each grid created by coordinate system.
2. Compile and store item list and coordinates within accessible area
3. Establish user location and store in xcurr and ycurr variables.
4. Prompt user for input requesting name of item that they are looking for
5. Loop through item list to determine coordinates for user destination. 
6. Set coordinates to xdest and ydest variables
7. If xcurr > xdest
    Calculate distance variable: (xcurr-xdest) * width from step 1
    Instruct user to move west by {distance}
   If xcurr < xdest
    Calculate distance variable: (xdest-xcurr) * width from step 1
    Instruct user to move east by {distance}
   If ycurr > ydest
    Calculate distance variable: (ycurr-ydest) * width from step 1
    Instruct user to move north by {distance}
   If ycurr < ydest
    Calculate distance variable: (ydest-ycurr) * width from step 1
    Instruct user to move south by {distance}
